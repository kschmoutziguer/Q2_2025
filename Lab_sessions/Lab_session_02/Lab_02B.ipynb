    "In this lab session, we will investigate the \"Value of Travel Time\" (VTT) distribution. The VTT of a traveller reflects the amount of money the traveller is **willing to pay** to reduce their travel time. The VTT is used to determine the benefits of new infrastructure projects. As travel time savings are the dominant and most salient benefits of new infrastructure, accurate inference of the distribution of the VTT is crucial for a rigorous underpinning of policy decisions. <br>\n",

    "During this lab, we will apply Mixed Logit choice models. We aim to uncover how tastes for travel time and travel cost are distributed in the population. Most of the analyses in this lab session are carried out in the so-called willingness-to-pay space. Willingness-to-pay space facilitates the inference of the VTT distribution.<br>\n",

The data set consists of 5,832 participants, resulting in a total of 52,488 choice observations. The figure below shows one of the choice tasks (note that for the purposes of illustration we converted the currency unit (Kronor) into euros).\n",
