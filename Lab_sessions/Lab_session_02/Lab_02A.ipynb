The data set consists of 5,832 participants, resulting in a total of 52,488 choice observations.

When we would compute the VTT by taking the ratio of $\\beta_{time}$ over $\\beta_{cost}$ we end up dividing by **zero** because the **normal distribution** has mass at zero, see the left-hand side plot. In other words, the model predicts some people don't care about cost. This implies that when we compute the VTT, we divide by zero. In other words, the model implies that some people have a $\\beta_{tc} of 0$ and, by extension, an infinite VTT. As a result, the **mean** VTT would be infinite as well. As such, a normally distributed $\\beta_{tc}$ is generally **not a good idea** if one wants to compute the mean VTT."

    "The results under 3.2 (and intuition) tell us that people are differently sensitive to cost. But, as discussed under 3.3, we cannot specify $\\beta_{tc}$ as a randomly distributed parameter (or, to be more precise, not as one that uses a distribution which has support over the full domain [-∞,∞], like a normal distribution). To circumvent this problem, we can cleverly re-parameterise our model. This **reparametrisation** involves a transformation from **`utility space`** to **`Willingness-to-Pay (WTP) space`**. This transformation allows us to estimate the VTT (distribution) directly, and simplifies the modelling. It works as follows:<br><br>\n",

However, for models estimated in WTP space and more complex models in general, the starting values can have impact. When estimating the VTT in the WTP space, it is good practice to provide **reasonable starting values** (thus starting values which imply a nonzero, positive VTT).\n",
