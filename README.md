# SEN122A- Statistical Analysis of Choice Behaviour 2025

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the *Choice behaviour modelling* section of the SEN112A course repository. In this repository, you will find Jupyter notebooks for the lab sessions, step-by-step instructions for setting up your Python environment, and a discussion forum where you can ask questions related to the course content.
   

## 2. Course description

Mathematical models of choice behaviour –henceforth referred to as "Discrete Choice Models" (DCMs)– are widely used to study the decision-making behaviour of individuals across numerous domains, including transportation, marketing, and health. DCMs are used to infer preferences over attributes and alternatives and predict the impact of new policies.

This course aims to equip students in the socio-technical domain with a comprehensive understanding of DCMs. You will learn the theoretical underpinnings of choice models and gain practical hands-on experience in estimating and applying these models to solve real-world problems.  

The course consists of oral lectures and lab sessions. During the lab sessions, students will work with Python-based tools to estimate models and analyze datasets. Attendance at both the lectures and lab sessions is highly recommended to keep up with the course content, although it is not mandatory.

Below, you can find the dates for the lab sessions and the practical exams:

## 3. Lab sessions
### 3.1. Overview of lab sessions
Lab sessions are offered in the form of Jupyter notebooks and aim to demonstrate and reinforce knowledge about discrete choice models, the underlying assumptions, estimation techniques, and how to interpret outcomes. They provide **hands-on** experience in discrete choice modelling, which is essential to master the method. Each lab session comprises two parts: A and B, and include a series of **exercises**.

`Lab session 1` introduces discrete choice models, focusing specifically on the Multinomial Logit (MNL) model based on random utility theory. You will acquire skills to explore choice datasets, build and estimate choice models using specialised Python package called Biogeme, and perform statistical tests to compare different model specifications.

`Lab session 2` focuses on the Mixed Logit models. You will gain proficiency in building and estimating various types of Mixed Logit models by altering assumptions about unobserved preference and taste heterogeneity. Furthermore, you will explore the impact of the number of draws on the estimation outcomes. 

`Lab session 3` focuses on the latest developments in the field: combining discrete choice modelling and machine learning for choice behaviour analysis. You will work with neural networks and explore how they can be integrated within utility-based choice models.   

For the lab sessions, we use Python notebooks (aka Jupyter Notebooks). You have two options to work with them. 
A. Anaconda
B. Pip 
For each option, **instructions** to set up your Python environment are given at the **end of this page**.

If you are **unfamiliar with Python**, we recommend completing [**lab session 0**](https://github.com/SEN1221TUD/Q2_2025/blob/main/Lab_sessions/Lab_session_00/lab_session_00.ipynb), which provides the necessary tools to conduct the lab sessions. It covers topics such as data structures, utilising external libraries, data exploration, visualisation, etc.

### 3.2. Lab Session publication dates
The lab sessions and answers will be available on the following dates:

## 5. Q&A forum

We use the [Issues](https://github.com/SEN1221TUD/Q2_2025/issues) section as the Q&A platform of this course (Part 1: Choice Behaviour Modelling). This is where you can post questions related to lecture content, lab sessions, or technical issues with Python. Before you create a new issue, please make sure that the same question hasn’t already been raised by one of your peers. You can also contribute to ongoing discussions by commenting on existing issues to continue the conversation or provide additional insights. As an example, we have already created the first issue; see [Issues](https://github.com/SEN1221TUD/Q2_2025/issues).

To create a new issue (question or problem) in the course repository, follow these steps:

1. Go to the "Issues" section of the course repository.
2. Click on "New issue" in the green button located at the upper right corner of your screen.
3. Add an informative title to your question or problem (e.g., "logit model of BIOGEME does not import in my notebook").
4. Describe your issue clearly and concisely. 
5. Add a topic label from the right-hand side. Click on the gear icon next to "Labels" and choose the label based on the topic of your question. 
6. Click on "Submit new issue" in the green button below the text description.

After that, the lecturer or teaching assistant will reply to your question. Also, you are encouraged to reply to questions posted by your fellow students! If you know how to help your fellow student with an issue, share your thoughts!

## 6. Instructions to set up your workspace

In this section, we will guide you through the configuration of your Python environment for the Choice Behaviour Modelling part of the course. You have to set up your environment once. This environment will work for all lab sessions.

### Setting up Python environment using Anaconda

Anaconda is a popular platform for managing Python environments. It is **strongly** recommended to create a **fresh** environment that uses Python version **3.12.11** or **3.12.12**.Other versions of Python, such as **3.10, 3.9 or  older**, are known to give some problems. Also, reusing an environment from another course is a recipe for installation troubles.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
